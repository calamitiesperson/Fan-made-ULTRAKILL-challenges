# List of all fan made ULTRAKILL challenges.
<details>
<summary>Clash Mode only</summary>
Clash Mode is an unlockable cheat that can be enabled in the cheats menu.
In order to unlock the Clash Mode cheat, you have to break all boxes in 4-S.
The challenge is really simple. You have to go to Sandbox and press O and leave.
Then you go to 0-1 and play only clash mode from there to 6-2.

<summary>ULTRAFIST</summary>
Basically you only can use the fists. You can't pickup any weapons, only the revolver which is
neccesarry to start the game. After you get a weapon you have to uneqiup it once you have the chance to do that.
You can use every hand, theres no limitation to that.

<summary>ULTRAPARRY</summary>
You can only defeat enemies by parrying their attacks. This is harder than the ULTRAFIST
challenge because you can only damage enemies when theyre going to attack you, and good timing
is neccesarry.

<summary>please help yourself (alt name: the most feared torture device in existance)</summary>
No, the name is not a joke. This challenge is the ULTRARAGE challenge but MUCH, MUCH WORSE.
Basically you have to P-rank every level the first time you play it, while also not getting damaged,
collecting all the secrets, and doing the challenges. You can replay a level when it has a challenge similar
to the 0-3 challenge or 4-1 challenge. If you fail, you have to delete the save file and start all over again.
PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT TRY THIS. This is probably worse than dying IRL. (unless you wanna go insane)
