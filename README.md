<summary>Clash Mode only</summary>
Clash Mode is an unlockable cheat that can be enabled in the cheats menu.
In order to unlock the Clash Mode cheat, you have to break all boxes in 4-S.
The challenge is really simple. You have to go to Sandbox and press O and leave.
Then you go to 0-1 and play only clash mode from there to 6-2.

Status: **COMPLETED**

<summary>ULTRAFIST</summary>
Basically you only can use the fists. You can't pickup any weapons, only the revolver which is
neccesarry to start the game. After you get a weapon you have to uneqiup it once you have the chance to do that.
You can use every hand, theres no limitation to that.

Status: **COMPLETED**

<details>
<summary>ULTRAPARRY</summary>
You can only defeat enemies by parrying their attacks. This is harder than the ULTRAFIST
challenge because you can only damage enemies when theyre going to attack you, and good timing
is neccesarry.

P-rank every level on violent on new save on the first try without getting damaged,
if you lose the challenge you have to delete the save file and try again.

Status: **UNKNOWN** (probably uncompleted)

Status: **UNCOMPLETED**

<summary>please help yourself (alt name: the most feared torture device in existance)</summary>
No, the name is not a joke. This challenge is the ULTRARAGE challenge but MUCH, MUCH WORSE.
Basically you have to P-rank every level the first time you play it, while also not getting damaged,
collecting all the secrets, and doing the challenges. You can replay a level when it has a challenge similar
to the 0-3 challenge or 4-1 challenge. If you fail, you have to delete the save file and start all over again.
Also, you have to play with PSX graphics, (you can edit it however you want, the default settings are good enough)
AND on violent difficulty. (once ukmd releases you have to play with that)
PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT TRY THIS. This is probably worse than dying IRL. (unless you wanna go insane)

Status: **UNCOMPLETED FOR MAYBE FOREVER**

<summary>No alt fire</summary>
It's exactly what you think it is. You aren't allowed to use alt fire.
I recommend just binding alt fire to an obscure key (like Â¨) so you wont use it accidentally.
You can just not bind it and try playing without touching it accidentally if you wanna go insane.
By the way, if you accidentally alt fire you just have to restart the level, no need to delete the save file.
You can play it that way if you're insane.

Status: **UNCOMPLETED**

<details>
<summary>One weapon and fist at a time</summary>
Basically, you can only use one weapon and fist at a time.
Every mission you switch weapons and fists. Whiplash counts too.

Status: **UNCOMPLETED**

<details>
<summary>ULTRAWAFFLE</summary>
(Mod credit: @Waff1e_ on YT) Very simple. You can only play with weapons and fists from
the mod Waffle's Weapons. Heres a guide on how to install the mod: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhMKhFNtiNA

Status: **UNCOMPLETED**

<summary>Visual Hell</summary>
You have to set your screenshake setting up to JUICE, select the lowest resolution, select 36P (ABSURD) in the downscaling dropdown,
set dithering to 500%, texture warping to 200%, vertex warping to MODERN ART, enable custom
color pallette and select the "Pink and" color pallette, and finally, set color compression to INDIE ART GAME.
This will make the game basically unplayable. If you're an insane degenerate and this is too easy for you, you can
always mix this with a different challenge. The worst challenge you can add to this is please help yourself.

Status: **UNCOMPLETED**

<summary>Weaponless</summary>
Basically, no weapons OR fists. Guess you can only use the ground slam now.

Status: **UNCOMPLETED**
